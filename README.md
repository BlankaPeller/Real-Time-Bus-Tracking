# Real Time Bus Tracking


## Description

This is a small project completed by me during the MIT JavaScript Coding Bootcamp. This exercise is based on JavaScript and prebuilt functions from MapBox to create an animation showing the bus route from MIT's campus to Harvard's.

## Usage

To download, click the "Fork" button on the top right corner to clone the repository. When done, open the folder in which the files are stored, and open the index.html file in your browser. Wait for the map to load in. Click the button in the top left corner to start the animation.

## Roadmap

As it is right now, this project only shows a very basic animation using one route. However, in the future this program could be updated to show many or even all of the bus routes in the greater Boston area to give citizens necessary regarding bus routes in their city.
